# React with Jest (and Enzyme)

**tldr;** This was THE easy button.

I used create-react-app to set this up.  

I used this http://airbnb.io/enzyme/docs/guides/jest.html  for dom rendering as Jest recommends this. Mocha uses this too btw.   

If you want to customize create-react-app, you can. You can fork it. Here's a resource how to do that.
